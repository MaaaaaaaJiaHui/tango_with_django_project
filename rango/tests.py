# In order to run these tests, copy this module to your tango_with_django_project/rango/ directory.
# Once this is complete, run $ python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter6
#
# The tests will then be run, and the output displayed -- do you pass them all?
#
# Once you are done with the tests, delete the module. You don't need to put it in your Git repository
